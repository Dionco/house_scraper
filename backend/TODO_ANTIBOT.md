# TODO: Anti-Bot & Cookie Bypass Strategy for Web Scraping

## Phase 1: Browser Detection Avoidance
- [x] Use undetected-chromedriver for Selenium
- [x] Implement browser fingerprint spoofing (user-agent, screen, WebGL, etc.)
- [x] Remove automation indicators (webdriver, plugins, languages)

## Phase 2: IP and Request Management
- [x] Set up proxy rotation (residential preferred)
- [x] Implement request rate limiting and human-like delays

## Phase 3: CAPTCHA Handling
- [x] Avoid CAPTCHAs via slow, human-like behavior and good proxies
- [ ] Integrate automated CAPTCHA solving (2captcha, Anti-Captcha, etc.)
- [ ] (Optional) Research AI-powered OCR for simple CAPTCHAs

## Phase 4: Session and Cookie Management
- [x] Save and reuse session cookies
- [x] Implement session management (requests.Session, CSRF, etc.)

## Phase 5: Advanced Evasion Techniques
- [x] Simulate human behavior (mouse, scroll, random actions)
- [x] Handle JavaScript challenges in browser context

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Adaptation
- [x] Monitor for blocking/detection (status codes, keywords)
- [x] Implement adaptive fallback strategies (proxy, delay, fingerprint)

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Install undetected-chromedriver
- [ ] Set up proxy rotation
- [ ] Add request delays
- [ ] Remove automation indicators
- [ ] Set up cookie persistence
- [ ] (Advanced) Fingerprint spoofing, CAPTCHA solving, behavioral simulation, monitoring, fallback

## Legal & Ethical
- [ ] Review robots.txt and ToS
- [ ] Respect rate limits and data usage policies
